- Every time a user code is scanned a checkin is created which inturn helps keep track of number of people in the gym allowing other to plan their visit accorgingly
- Users can enter their goals like bulking, dieting, lifting etc and fin buddies whi have the same goals
- Users can also share their progress photos

### Admin Portal
